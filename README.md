# WKWebViewTest

Simple test to see how well communication between Angular (1 in this case, but will work just as well with 2) and Swift works.

Ignore the boilerplate stuff from angular-seed and the weird layout/html...

1. git clone
2. Run app
3. cd into AngularApp
4. npm install
5. npm start
6. Open Safari
7. Open the console for simulator
8. Refresh the webview (from Safari console)
9. Switch to Simulator, go to "view2" in the menu
10. Click on "Do some magic!"
11. Keep an eye on both Xcode console and Safari console ;)
